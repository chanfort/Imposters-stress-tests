This file will highlight what is being used from 3rd parties as well as links to relevant projects:

1. Parts of Imposters project (https://github.com/xraxra/IMP) was used in this repository. This project includes imposters shader. Imposters baking script was removed as this project is only for rendering previously baked imposters for stress testing purposes.

2. The Tree model was created using Blender (https://www.blender.org/) Sapling Plugin (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/add_curve/sapling.html) and exported as FBX file.

3. All my other code can be used under MIT License and included Tree model under CC0 License.
